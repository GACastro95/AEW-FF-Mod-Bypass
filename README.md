# AEW-FF-Mod-Bypass
Custom launcher for AEW Fight Forever v1.0, enabling mods without altering original executable.

To use this, place "AEW_CustomLauncher.exe" in the "Steam\steamapps\common\AEWFightForever\AEWFightForever\Binaries\Win64\" path. To enable mods, launch your game through this file. To set this as what Steam loads by default when pressing "PLAY", edit the game's launch options to ` "path to customlauncher.exe" %command%  `
